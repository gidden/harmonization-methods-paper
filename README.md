Harmonization is done to compare across models
Calibration reflects uncertainty in historical data (doesn’t like the term calibration)
Construct a smooth transition from new history which reflects uncertainty

1. Enhancing comparability
2. Consistent with single historical trajectory and **smooth transition**
3. Doing it in a systematic way for full reproducibility for anyone not involved in cmip6
4. **not an update**, “make usable for climate modeling teams”
5. Add example of a trajectories that shows issues with different methods in each context
6. MESSAGE is not an IAM, energy economic land use models
Ask Volker, Joeri
7. We don’t know that we underpin IPCC, “regularly assessed by the IPCC”
8. Sometimes calibration is to emissions inventories, other times its calibrated to decision variables
9. Rcps, then ssps, new generation of climate scenarios will combine them, and new scenarios are made (instead of saying climate models have updated)
10. Discussion and future work 
- Enables others to do this as well
- Consistent with future work
- Comapability allows for new generation of scenarios
