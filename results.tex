\section{Results \& Conclusions}

\subsection{A Harmonization Test Case}

In order to test the \code{aneris} code base and harmonization procedure,
results from the IAM MESSAGE-GLOBIOM \TODO{CITE} was processed using the
previously described combined historical dataset. The SSP2-RCP4.5 scenario was
chosen a test cases as it incorporates moderate to heavy mitigation strategies,
and therefore produces negative CO2 emissions for some regions and sectors. In
general, SSP2 scenarios describe a ``middle of the road'' world within the SSP
framework context. The 4.5 designation implies a scenario that results in
approximately a 4.5 $\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2}$ warming effect by the end of
the century, due to both warming from Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and flourinated
gases as well as cooling from aerosols.
