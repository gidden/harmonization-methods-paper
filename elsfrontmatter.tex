\begin{abstract}
Harmonization describes the process of calibrating Integrated Assessment Model
(IAM) results with a new source of historical emissions trajectories. To date,
harmonization has been performed separately by individual modeling teams through
the use of expert opinion and solicitation. As models and their results become
more complex in both regional and sectoral dimensions, an automated approach to
choosing harmonization methods becomes necessary. This work describes a novel
methodology for determining such harmonization methods and an open-source Python
code base for implementing the methodology. Results are shown for two example
scenarios using the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM IAM that satisfactorily harmonize over 98\%
of the total emissions trajectories. \cite{Dirac1953888}
