\begin{abstract}
Harmonization describes the process required to match Integrated Assessment
Model (IAM) GHG and air pollutants results against a common source of historical
emissions trajectories. To date, harmonization has been performed separately by
individual modeling teams through

the use of expert opinion and solicitation. In order to support ongoing and
future global climate and socioeconomic analyses, incorporate model advancements
towards more complex regional and sectoral representations, and expand the
capability of modeling teams to participate in intercomparison exercises, an
automated approach to choosing harmonization methods becomes necessary. This
work describes a novel

methodology for determining such harmonization methods and an open-source Python
code base for implementing the methodology. Results are shown for two example
scenarios (with and without climate policy cases) using the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM IAM that satisfactorily harmonize over 98\%
of the total emissions trajectories.
