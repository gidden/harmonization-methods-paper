\begin{abstract}
Harmonization describes the process required to match Integrated Assessment
Model (IAM) GHG and air pollutants results against a common source of historical
emissions trajectories. To date, harmonization has been performed separately by
individual modeling teams through

% IMAGE has provided harmonized emissions in the past, generated by a harmonization routine applying a ratio convergence method (on a higher aggregation level) (Hof et al., 2016). I think the contrast with these harmonization approaches and this work, which enables a documented, automated process selecting appropriate harmonization methodologies, might not be clear. Furthermore, later in the text cross-model harmonization methods (though less sophisticated) are mentioned. It is worth mentioning that previous approaches are far less sophisticated.

the use of expert opinion and solicitation. In order to support ongoing and
future global climate and socioeconomic analyses, incorporate model advancements
towards more complex regional and sectoral representations, and expand the
capability of modeling teams to participate in intercomparison exercises, an
automated approach to choosing harmonization methods becomes necessary. This
work describes a novel

methodology for determining such harmonization methods and an open-source Python
software library implementing the methodology. Results are shown for two example
scenarios (with and without climate policy cases) using the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM IAM
that satisfactorily harmonize over 96\% of the total emissions trajectories.
